            <p>
              In this UX case study I explore the potential of mobile devices
              and user interaction in the reducing and preventing of public
              littering. Data shows that public littering happens frequently,
              and close to 1 in 2Â of people admit having littered at least
              once.
            </p>

            <p>
              In a time during which the state of the environment is in peril,
              finding ways to help keep our world liveable are of upmost
              importance - LitterID is a concept that aims to contribute to
              that improvement.
            </p>

            <h3>The goal</h3>
            <p>
              At its core, litterID should be a benevolentÂ data-collection
              service. It should rely on the public's contribution to collect
              data on outdoor littering and use that data to aid in cleaning
              our living spaces.Â 
            </p>

            <h4>The app as a way to pinpoint problem zones</h4>
            <p>
              It should doÂ this by relying on a widely implemented solution of
              scannable QR-codes on most common packaging of consumer goods.
              Users can scan littered items, from which data can be derived,
              such as geographic occurrences, product type and brand, and even
              find common offenders.
            </p>


            <h4>The app as a way for users to work together</h4>
            <p>There should also be exploration in possibilities of social interaction within the app, and whether it
              might have a possible effect on use and engagement. Consideration should be put on the extend of social
              interactive capabilities of the app, keeping in mind the feasability and actual need of such functions for
              the app to
              function. </p>

          <h3>Main Challenge</h3>

          <p>
            Important consideration in the design fase is its purpose of being a highly versatile and accessible app
            that is minimally intrusive on the user, while enticing the user to engage with the app as well as its
            cause. Clear definition of the systems intentions and functions are
            important, as most of litterID's moving parts are invisible to the
            user.

          <h4>Lockdown</h4>

          <p>
            Soon after starting this UX project, the outbreak of the Covid-19
            virus occurred. The resulting lockdown placed many restrictions on
            the possibilities of conducting UX research and user testing, thus
            as a concept study I am working with the tools and options I am
            given. I will be designing and testing usability primarily based
            on existing similar apps and will test with more users during the
            validation process of the case.

          <h3>Research insight</h3>

          <p>
            Littering is an everyday problem that we might have grown too
            accustomed to. However, it is still an issue that needs to be
            addressed and eliminated.Â 
          </p>

          <ul>
            <h4>Key findings</h4>
            <li>
              Thirty percent of people in the UK considers littering an issue.
            </li>
            <li>Littering is a huge cost on society.</li>
            <li>Most fly tipping consists of household waste.</li>
            <li>
              Most littering consists of wrappers or containers from food or
              consumer items.
            </li>
            <li>Of people in the UK, 48% admits to having littered.</li>
            <li>
              Smoking related products and food packaging make up most of
              littered items.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Insight</h4>
          <p class="emphasis">
            The facts don't lie: littering is still a reoccuring issue in
            practically all places. No one likes seeing their area littered,
            so the information here can be a motivator for people to want to
            do something about it.
          </p>

          <h3>Apps that could inspire the design</h3>
          <p>
            While there isn't a mainstream app in particular focussed on
            identifying and collecting crowd-sourced data on public littering,
            there are plenty of apps which have similar functionalities and
            purposes, such as generic QR-scanners, camera apps,
            community/social boards, and rewards apps. Another important
            aspect of the LitterID concept is using the app primarily
            outdoors, for which there are also many apps which could function
            as an example.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <h4>Other apps tested</h4>
            <li><b>QR-scanner</b> - Main focus as a utitily, simple to use, quick to start.</li>
            <li><b>Meetup</b> - Minimal social interaction, higher focus on event organizing.</li>
            <li><b>Pokemon Go</b> - Safety during use is emphasized, keeps track of location, gamifies real life
              actions.</li>
          </ul>

              willing to contribute a smaller effort to improve the environment if there is direct positive feedback for

          <h3>Making sure people want to use it</h3>
          <h4>It's not about the scanning</h4>
          <p>
            Besides its main function being a utility app to collect outside data, LitterID should be more than that
            to the user. To get users onboard and engaged with the program, it is important that they have the right
            incentives and stimulations to do so.
          </p>

          <p>
            One important factor of enticing users is by positive social encouragement.
            Including a platform of social interactions on the app takes obligation away from the data collection
            function, transforming it into a positive aspect of play and challenge. It turns the objective
            from an effortsome lonely experience, to a connection to community that the user can use to work together
            with others.
          </p>

          <h4>Show users how they are helping</h4>
          <p>
            Along with direct social interaction, the LitterID should also give users direct feedback, both personal and
            collective. Collective positive feedback would give the user a direct notice of how their efforts have
            improved the greater status of their area, for example by displaying statistics of litter decrease.
          </p>

          <p>
            Personal feedback can come from a score reward system from which users can receive tangible rewards for
            using the app. It can be from interaction with other users, participating in community efforts, or even from
            the ability of personalizing the app.

              For it's color pallette, LitterID uses an orange-yellow (<span style="color: #F7C86C;">#F7C86C</span>) as
              it's primary color, and a dark cyan
              (<span style="color: #2C65A4;">#2C65A4</span>) as its secondary color. In this case, orange-yellow
              functions well as a generally appealing tint, giving off
              credible and authorative, yet playful and energizing vibes. Paired with dark cyan it creates a great
              visual contrast for accessible app navigation. Together on a white (#ffffff) ground these tints
              create a coherent and harmonious appearance that is both recognizable and accessible.

              Element size is an important part of any interface design. LitterID uses 3 systems to create an accessible

              <ul style="margin: 0; margin-bottom: 8rem;">
                <li>Following Google's guidelines for ideal sizes of interactive content on mobile interface.</li>
                <li>Using the golden ratio as a scaling measurement, creating harmony in relations between elements of
                  various sizes.</li>
                <li>Using a pixel-grid divisable by 4 assures that all elements have minimally needed room to breath and

              typefaces with an accessible humanistic character and a widely applicable style for font in different
              sizes. "Sofia Pro" should be used for larger fonts, such as headers, graphical text, while the "soft"
              variant should be used for smaller fonts, such as paragraphs, buttons, labels and other interactable
              elements.

              user
              scrolls further down they can find more messages and information. From here the user can navigate to the

            <p>As a primary function of the app, the scanner should be the easiest function to use and quickest to
              access. To ensure the scanner is always a tap away, there is always an overlaying thumb-button on the
              higher surface sections of the LitterID app.</p>

            <h4>Scanning is effortless</h4>
            <p>The scanner is supposed to be used outside and to ensure the quickest and easiest user experience,
              scanning happens automatically whenever it can. It does so by visually recognizing objects and pinpointing
              QR-emblems, capturing them, and processing in the background. At that point, the user has already
              progressed to the next stage.</p>

          <h3>Avoiding system abuse</h3>
          <p>Users might want to try to cheat the system by using the app and scanner in ways it is not intended.</p>
          <p>Ways they might do so are by scanning any scannable products, whether it has been littered or not. Another
            way might be by scanning products still in store shelves.</p>
          <ul>
            <h4>Preventative measures</h4>
            <li>Location access is required to use the app.</li>
            <li>To be able to use the scanner, the user should be outdoors and movement needs to have been detected
              within a certain period.</li>
            <li>Reward should not exceed effort. Users feel the reward is enough to fairly use the app, but not enough
              to justify abuse.</li>
            <li>The scanner is deactivated in supermarkets, fastfood restaurants, and other places that sell consumer
              products.</li>
            <li>A learning algoritm learns what litter looks like, filtering out products that appear unlittered (like
              packaged products on shelves, in prestine condition, or indoors, etc)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Some of these functions are simple to enforce, while others would require significantly more consideration,
            both in cost and time. However, failure to implement such functions might result in the ultimate failure of
            the app, therefor significant attention should be spent on these aspects throughout later stages of design,
            development and testing.</p>

            <p>LitterID has a system that allows users to interact with eachother. These functions add an additional
              dimension of use to the app and strengthen the sense of a LitterID user community.</p>
            <p>This community is something that would greatly benefit the level of engagement that the app (and therefor
              the greater purpose of litter prevention) receive from users.</p>
            <p>Users can message eachother, creating an environment that keeps users focussed on a cause. This, rather
              than shipping off user interaction to general communication apps, which might just add additional steps
              for simple communication.</p>

            <p>Groups (or crews) on LitterID can be joined by other users. The purpose of groups is for users to
              interact, engage, and help in real-life locations with others in their area. Groups are free to meet up

            <p>Participation in groups can grant additional benefits to individual users, such as receiving

            <div class="article__comboImgCopy-header">Why create an app to scan junk?</div>
            <p>I designed LitterID because I wanted to create a mobile app that did something to make a difference. As a
              personal case study, I could just as well have designed a mobile app that was more common and certain in
              it's possibility of success. How can you even get people engaged in an app that scans litter? Finding out
              how to create an app that could get people to use it for that purpose was the main challenge of this case
              study.</p>
            <p>Litter is one of those things that effects us all to an extend, but it is something we are always
              hessitant to deal with. No one wants to live in a mess and most of us don't want to clean up what isn't
              theirs. Despite this general consensus, there are still people who leave their houses to make a
              difference. They gather in their spare time with others to put on a safety vest and clean a place of
              litter that isn't theirs. I had an itching idea that there was a way to get more people active to this
              cause, without asking them to sacrifice their weekends.</p>
            <p>LitterID intends to give everyone the ability to help. Coming up with a way to get people engaged was a
              challenge for which I was able to find a solution in the form of gamification, user community, and reward
              systems. Finding a balance between these functions and aspects was important, as the app had to focus on
              each function evenly, not to overshadow the others.</p>
            <p>In the end I am happy with the results: LitterID is an app that aims to connect people in fighting a
              common annoyance, together. It gives people who did not think they could make a difference a way to
              contribute what they can.</p>
